              <p> Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, We'll put a happy little sky in here. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. I thought today we would do a happy little picture.</p>

              <p> But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. Now then, let's play. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying.</p>
