              <p> Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. We'll put a happy little sky in here. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. I thought today we would do a happy little picture.</p>

              <p> This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. There are no limits in this world. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. You are only limited by your imagination. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there.</p>

              <p> But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. Now then, let's play. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying.</p>
