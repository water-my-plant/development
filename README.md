Water My Plants ReadMe

With plants in and around the house it's easy to neglect or even water them too much.  Many a plant has died from
over watering.  Why?  Because its owners did not keep to the proper watering schedule for their plant.  Orchids 
need consistent but different watering than cacti.  And even within the cactus variety, watering can differ species
to species.  

Enter Water My Plants.  The full service water concierge service that does the research for you.  All you have to 
do is select a plant species and Water My Plants will send you reminders of when your plant needs its nourishment.
 Never again will you have the disdain of walking into your kitchen and seeing your green houseplant wilted, bent 
 over, and browned by the sun.  It's all in our hands now.  Take ease and take action with Water My Plants.
 
 Water My Plants is a fun, interactive web app for desktop and mobile that enables users to receive reminders to
